Hazard Characterization
***********************

This testbed considers the wind hazard and its affect on the building inventory.

As the initial implementation of the regional assessment workflow, the testbed mainly
adapted the HAZUS Hurricane Damage and Loss Assessment methodology to quantify the
hazard the intensity measure Peak Wind Speed (PWS), which refers to maximum wind speed average over a 3-second gust and measured at 10m height
and under the open terrain surface condition (equivalent to the Exposure C in ASCE 7-16).
