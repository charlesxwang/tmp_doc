Overview
********

This testbed is developed for demonstrating a regional risk assessment of the building system in Lake Charles, Louisiana, 
under the wind hazard caused by Hurricane Laura.
It intends to show the computational scaffolding
upon which community developers can progressively contribute refinements that 
increase the backend regional resilience assessment workflow's fidelity and capacities. Featured by the workflow
offering a sufficient resolution, the testbed can investigate the performance of a specific asset within the region of interest.

The major components in this testbed include (1) asset inventory, (2) hazard characterization, (3) asset representation, 
(4) damage and loss model, and (5) sampling results. This testbed includes 54,456 assets in the city of Lake Charles. 
The wind hazard is characterized by the intensity measure of the Peak Wind Speed (PWS), 
which is adopted from the wind field estimation release by ARA, while interpolations are performed to
evaluate the intensity measures at the site of each asset. The description of assets in the inventory adopts the HAZUS building classifications. 
For the initial implementation of the backend workflow, the HAZUS damage and loss assessment methodology for hurricane hazards is adopted in this testbed. 
The building inventory is generated by `BRAILS <https://github.com/NHERI-SimCenter/BRAILS>`_ based on street view and satellite images using deep learning. 
Multiple runs with varying building attributes are also conducted to inspect the sensitivity of the model. 
Simulation results are presented to verify the workflow and demonstrate its usage.
