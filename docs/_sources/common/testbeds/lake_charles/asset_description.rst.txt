The description of assets in the inventory adopts the HAZUS building classifications. 
The building inventory is generated by `BRAILS <https://github.com/NHERI-SimCenter/BRAILS>`_ based on street view and satellite images using deep learning. 

It is estimated that wood residential building is the predominant structure type in this region.
Therefore, all buildings in the inventory are assumed to be wood residential buildings in the analysis. 
Based on the assumption, `BRAILS <https://github.com/NHERI-SimCenter/BRAILS>`_ further 
refines the building types as single-family (RES1) or multi-family (RES3) building based on their occupancy class inferred from street view image.
The inference shows 94% of the buildings in this region can be classified as single-family building, the rest are multi-family building.



Processing Method of Building Inventory
========================================

This section, organized by the workflow's progressive levels of fidelity, describes how a large-scale
building inventory was derived for the case study region.

At Level 1, a building inventory is created using `BRAILS <https://github.com/NHERI-SimCenter/BRAILS>`_ that
leverages machine learning and image processing to generate attributes required for the corresponding
Level-1 loss assessment. 
It is emphasized that the intent is to demonstrate how an inventory could
be constructed and not to address potential errors, omissions or inaccuracies in the source data,
i.e., source data are assumed to be accurate and no additional quality assurance was conducted outside
of addressing glaring omissions or errors.

Phase I: Attribute Definition
------------------------------

All the attributes required for loss estimation were first identified to develop the Building Inventory
data model, which catalogs each attribute, its purpose, its format (alphanumeric, floating point number,
etc.), the data source used to define that attribute and the field(s) needed from that data source, any
transformations of that source data necessary to align with the units or conventions used in the Building
Inventory, and any relevant details explaining notations, assumptions, or reference documents (:numref:`bldg_inv_dm_lc`).

Phase II: Building Footprint 
------------------------------

The Atlantic County Building Inventory was populated with Footprint Data 
from the `Microsoft Footprint Dataset <https://github.com/microsoft/USBuildingFootprints>`_ .


Phase III: Augmentation Using Image Processing
----------------------------------------------

A number of required attributes pertaining to externally-visible features of the building, such as 
 roof shape, roof slope, building
elevations and the number of stories were augmented using image processing techniques.
As roof geometry is not a standard field in MOD IV data, satellite imagery is processed to further augment
the basic parcel data. 
The SimCenter developed application Building Recognition using Artificial Intelligence
at Large Scales, BRAILS ([Wang19]_), is used to interpret satellite images of building roofs, which
are collected from Google Maps.  The satellite images are labeled with shape types to form a dataset, upon
which a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained so that it can give rapid predictions of roof types
when given new images of roofs.  Microsoft Building Footprint data is used as the location index when
downloading images automatically from Google Maps. While more complex roof shapes could in theory be
classified, the current use of HAZUS damage and loss functions required the use of similitude measures to
define each roof as an “effective” gable, hip or flat geometry. Using BRAILS, this classification was
achieved with approximately 85% accuracy based on validation studies.
